# Shramik Sakshi 🛠️
### Empowering the Unorganized Workforce with Digital Wage Protection

Shramik Sakshi is an automated wage protection and attendance verification system designed for the unorganized labor sector. By leveraging simple technology—WhatsApp and GPS—we provide laborers with an immutable "Digital Receipt" for every day of work, ensuring they have the proof needed to fight wage theft.

---

## 💡 The Problem
Millions of daily wage laborers face the constant risk of "wage theft," where contractors deny they worked specific days or withhold payments without evidence. Existing solutions require apps, smartphones, and digital literacy that the average laborer often lacks.

## 🚀 The Solution
**Shramik Sakshi** removes barriers. No app to install. No registration forms.
1. **Attendance:** A laborer sends their location via WhatsApp.
2. **Verification:** The system generates an immediate, timestamped digital receipt.
3. **Transparency:** An NGO Dashboard tracks work history, providing a ledger that can be presented during labor disputes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Messaging:** Twilio API for WhatsApp
- **Frontend/Dashboard:** Streamlit (Cloud-hosted)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
